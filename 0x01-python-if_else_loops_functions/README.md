# Directory : 0x01 Python - if_else_loops_functions

![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-generic.svg)

This directory contains Python scripts and examples related to the fundamental concepts of control flow and functions in Python. It covers the following topics:

1. **Conditional Statements (if...else)**: Learn how to use conditional statements to make decisions in your Python programs. Explore the use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of your code.

2. **Loops (for and while)**: Understand how to create loops in Python using `for` and `while` constructs. Explore how loops can be used for repetitive tasks and iterations.

3. **Functions**: Discover the power of functions in Python. Learn how to define and call functions, pass arguments, return values, and use function scope.

## Contents

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A simple script that checks if a random number is positive, negative, or zero using if...else statements.

- `1-last_digit.py`: This script computes the last digit of a given number and determines if it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or equal to 0.

- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A script that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using a `for` loop.

- `3-print_alphabt.py`: This script prints the lowercase alphabet except for the letters 'q' and 'e' using a `for` loop.

- `4-print_hexa.py`: A script that prints hexadecimal numbers from 0 to 98 using a `for` loop.

- `5-print_comb2.py`: This script prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using nested `for` loops.

- `6-print_comb3.py`: A script that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, avoiding repetition, using nested `for` loops and conditionals.

- `7-islower.py`: This script defines a function `islower(c)` that checks if a character is a lowercase letter.

- `8-uppercase.py`: A script that defines a function `uppercase(str)` to convert all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.

- `9-print_last_digit.py`: This script defines a function `print_last_digit(number)` to print the last digit of a given number.

- `10-add.py`: A script that defines a function `add(a, b)` to add two numbers and return the result.

- `11-pow.py`: This script defines a function `pow(a, b)` to calculate the power of a number.

- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A classic programming task: a script that prints numbers from 1 to 100 but replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."

- `13-insert_number.c`: A C program that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
