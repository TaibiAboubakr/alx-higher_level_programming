# Directory : 0x05-python-exceptions

## Description : 
This directory contains Python scripts and related files that demonstrate the concept of exceptions in Python programming. Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of the program. Python provides mechanisms to handle these exceptions, allowing for graceful error handling and recovery.

## File Descriptions

0-safe_print_list.py: A Python script that defines a function to safely print elements from a list, handling exceptions that may occur during the process.

1-safe_print_integer.py: A Python script that defines a function to safely print an integer, handling exceptions that may occur if the provided value is not an integer.

2-safe_print_list_integers.py: A Python script that defines a function to safely print the first n integers from a list, handling exceptions that may occur if the list contains non-integer values.

3-safe_print_division.py: A Python script that defines a function to divide two numbers and handle exceptions related to division by zero.

4-list_division.py: A Python script that divides corresponding elements of two lists and handles exceptions related to invalid divisions.

5-raise_exception.py: A Python script that raises a specific exception (a NameError) to demonstrate how exceptions can be explicitly raised.

6-raise_exception_msg.py: A Python script that raises a NameError exception with a custom error message.

100-safe_print_integer_err.py: A Python script that defines a function to safely print an integer and catch exceptions, printing an error message to standard error in case of an exception.

101-safe_function.py: A Python script that defines a function to execute a given function safely, handling exceptions and printing error messages to standard error.

102-magic_calculation.py: A Python script containing a function with a complex set of operations to illustrate how Python bytecode works.
